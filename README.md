Hi, I'm Tianyi Zhuang, an open source lover.

My current main interest is in databases and streaming systems. I'm involved in the [TiKV community][tikv], and they promoted me as a committer. Besides that, I have been involved in many other projects such as [RisingWave][risingwave], [TiDB][tidb], [DataBend][databend] and [RisingLight][risinglight].

I'm also a big fan of [Rust language][rust language] and try to involve the Rust community.

Currently I am working on the streaming compute engine of [RisingWave][risingwave] at [@RisingWaveLabs][risingwavelabs].

I used to worked in the PolarDB-X team at Alibaba and am responsible for developing transaction-related features. After I left Alibaba, PolarDB-X was [open-sourced][polardb-x].

Before Alibaba, I was an AI-infra SWE at [Megvii Inc][megvii]. I designed and implemented the Overlay OSS, which supports the entire data storage, cleaning, and training process in Megvii Research.

I graduated from Tsinghua University with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. In my final year, I participated in the [CCPC](https://ccpc.io) and won a gold medal at the regional level.
